        <h1>About Me:</h1>
        <h2>Abigail Gwydir</h2>
        <p>My name is <b>Abbey Gwydir</b> and I am a senior at the University of Miami! </p>
        <p>I am a Business Technology major with a minor in Interactive Media.</p>
        <p>I recently applied for Teach for America. My ultimate goal in life is to find ways to bridge the 'technlogy gap' that exists between low-income and high-income students, so that all kids get an equal chance to succeed in our technology driven world.</p>
        <p>I also like dogs a lot. </p>
